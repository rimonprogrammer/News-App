<h4>International News APP</h4>
<p>
This is an International News App project. Here you can watch daily top and updated International news. I have added an awesome feature to this project which is infinite scrolling. When you'll scroll down then it will show the all news until the news will not end. There are six categories in the web application. These are science, Technology, Business, Sports, Health, entertainment, etc.

<ul>
  <li>React-JS</li>

</ul>

<p>Note: I've made this project with a free news API. But they aren't providing to allow this project to live in this free version. That's why I couldn't deploy this project in live. But you can get the actual code of this application. In the below, I've provided github URL to get this project's code</p>
